# Go Diagrams with Only LaTeX

There are 3 main alternatives to doing this:

- [psgo](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks/contrib/psgo/)
- [igo](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/igo)
- Creating a new Package with TikZ
  - TikZ also offers a way of making this interactive, so we could achieve the same level of interactivity as [GoBooks](https://gobooks.com/)' EPUBs.
